# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a visual dashboard that displays the real-time health status of cloud provider services across different regions on an interactive world map. The system monitors public status feeds from major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, OCI) and displays service health through color-coded regions, enabling users to quickly identify service disruptions and view detailed incident information. The dashboard is designed for wall displays, TV monitors, and desktop viewing with automatic updates every 15 minutes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to see a world map with cloud provider regions color-coded by service health status, so that I can quickly identify service disruptions across different geographic locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display an interactive world map as the primary interface
2. WHEN cloud provider regions are displayed THEN the system SHALL overlay AWS, Azure, GCP, and OCI regions on the map
3. WHEN all services in a region are operational THEN the system SHALL display the region in green color
4. WHEN some services in a region have issues THEN the system SHALL display the region in yellow color for minor issues or red color for major outages
5. WHEN the map is zoomed into a specific region THEN the system SHALL display availability zones within that region when applicable

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the dashboard to automatically refresh service status data every 15 minutes, so that I have current information without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard is running THEN the system SHALL automatically fetch status data from public cloud provider feeds every 15 minutes
2. WHEN status data is updated THEN the system SHALL refresh the visual indicators on the map without requiring a page reload
3. WHEN the system fetches data THEN it SHALL only use publicly available RSS feeds and status APIs that do not require authentication
4. WHEN data fetching fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue using the last known good data
5. WHEN the dashboard starts THEN the system SHALL immediately fetch the latest status data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user monitoring cloud services, I want to click on a region to see which specific services are affected, so that I can understand the scope of any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a region THEN the system SHALL display a regional view showing affected services at a high level
2. WHEN the regional view is displayed THEN the system SHALL list all services with their current status (operational, degraded, outage)
3. WHEN displaying service status THEN the system SHALL group services by cloud provider within the region
4. WHEN no services are affected in a region THEN the system SHALL display "All services operational" message
5. WHEN the user clicks away from the regional view THEN the system SHALL return to the main map view

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user investigating a service issue, I want to click on a specific service incident to see detailed information, so that I can understand the nature and impact of the problem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a service with an active incident THEN the system SHALL display a detailed incident panel sliding in from the right side
2. WHEN the incident detail panel is shown THEN it SHALL display incident title, description, affected services, start time, and current status
3. WHEN the incident detail panel is open THEN the system SHALL allow the user to scroll through multiple incidents if present
4. WHEN the user clicks outside the incident panel THEN the system SHALL hide the panel and return to the previous view
5. WHEN incident details are unavailable THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating limited information is available

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user setting up the dashboard for display purposes, I want the interface to work well on large screens and TV displays, so that it can serve as a status board for teams.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard is displayed on large screens THEN the system SHALL scale appropriately for TV and wall display viewing
2. WHEN displayed on large screens THEN text and visual elements SHALL be large enough to read from a distance
3. WHEN the dashboard is idle THEN the system SHALL not display any screen savers or sleep modes that would interfere with continuous display
4. WHEN the dashboard is used for display purposes THEN the system SHALL provide a full-screen mode option
5. WHEN the dashboard detects no user interaction for extended periods THEN it SHALL continue updating data automatically

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer working with the dashboard locally, I want to use localStorage for state management and run a local test version, so that I can develop and test without external dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in local development mode THEN the system SHALL use localStorage to persist map state and user preferences
2. WHEN the dashboard is refreshed THEN the system SHALL restore the last viewed map position and zoom level from localStorage
3. WHEN running locally THEN the system SHALL provide mock data options for testing when external APIs are unavailable
4. WHEN localStorage is not available THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to in-memory state management
5. WHEN clearing browser data THEN the system SHALL reset to default map view and settings

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the system to only use publicly available cloud provider status sources, so that no authentication or paid accounts are required to operate the dashboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fetching AWS status data THEN the system SHALL use the AWS Service Health Dashboard RSS feed or public API
2. WHEN fetching Azure status data THEN the system SHALL use the Azure Status public RSS feed or API
3. WHEN fetching GCP status data THEN the system SHALL use the Google Cloud Status public feed
4. WHEN fetching OCI status data THEN the system SHALL use the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure public status feed
5. WHEN any cloud provider changes their public feed format THEN the system SHALL handle parsing errors gracefully and log appropriate warnings
