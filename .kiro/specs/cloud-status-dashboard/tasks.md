  **Summary:** Successfully implemented comprehensive active incident detection system for all 4 cloud providers with 100% region coverage.

  **Completed Work:**
  - ✅ Database Schema Enhancement
    - Added `is_active` column (BOOLEAN) to track active vs resolved incidents
    - Added `severity` column (VARCHAR) for incident classification (high/medium/low)
    - Added `status_impact` column (VARCHAR) for GCP-specific status data
    - Added `detection_confidence` column (VARCHAR) to track detection quality (high/medium/low)
    - Created indexes: `idx_cloud_status_is_active`, `idx_cloud_status_active_provider_region`
    - Updated database functions to filter by `is_active`
    - Created `active_incidents` view for frontend queries
    - Migration: `database/migration-add-is-active-v2.sql` ✅
    - View Fix: `database/fix-active-incidents-view-v2.sql` ✅

  - ✅ AWS Active Incident Detection (Enhanced)
    - Active keyword detection: `['investigating', 'identified', 'monitoring', 'ongoing', 'experiencing']`
    - Resolved keyword detection: `['resolved', 'restored', 'completed', 'fixed']`
    - Severity classification: High (outage), Medium (degraded), Low (maintenance)
    - Filters resolved incidents before database write
    - Confidence scoring: High for keyword matches, Medium for age-based fallback
    - Detection accuracy: High confidence

  - ✅ Azure Active Incident Detection (Enhanced)
    - Active keyword detection: `['investigating', 'preliminary', 'ongoing', 'mitigating']`
    - Resolved keyword detection: `['resolved', 'mitigated', 'restored', 'completed']`
    - Severity classification based on impact level
    - Filters resolved incidents before database write
    - Detection accuracy: High confidence

  - ✅ GCP Active Incident Detection (Enhanced - Most Reliable)
    - Uses explicit `incident.end` timestamp for active detection
    - Active if `!incident.end` (no end time = ongoing)
    - Severity from `status_impact`: SERVICE_OUTAGE → high, SERVICE_DISRUPTION → medium
    - Confidence: Always "high" (structured data with timestamps)
    - Detection accuracy: Very high confidence (timestamp-based)

  - ✅ OCI Active Incident Detection (NEW - Previously Incomplete)
    - Active keyword detection: `['investigating', 'identified', 'monitoring', 'ongoing']`
    - Resolved keyword detection: `['resolved', 'completed', 'restored']`
    - Severity classification: Major/Critical → high, Minor/Moderate → medium
    - Status-based detection using `incident.status` field
    - Filters resolved incidents before database write
    - Detection accuracy: High confidence
    - File: `scripts/update-status.js` (lines 429-517)

  - ✅ Complete Region Mapping Coverage
    - Generated from source data: `src/data/regions.ts` + `src/data/additional-regions.ts`
    - AWS: 37 regions (was 8) - 100% coverage
    - Azure: 59 regions (was 7) - 100% coverage
    - GCP: 41 regions (was 4) - 100% coverage
    - OCI: 39 regions (was 3) - 100% coverage
    - Total: 176 regions (was 19) - 100% coverage
    - Generator: `scripts/generate-region-mappings.js`
    - Output: `scripts/region-mappings.js` (auto-generated)

  - ✅ Backend-Frontend Integration Fixed
    - Frontend already using Supabase correctly (no changes needed to MapContainer)
    - Updated `src/lib/supabase.ts` to query `active_incidents` view
    - Real-time subscription support maintained
    - Removed old CORS proxy RSS fetching (was bypassing backend)

  - ✅ End-to-End Testing & Verification
    - RSS processor tested live against production Supabase
    - All 4 providers processed successfully: AWS ✅ Azure ✅ GCP ✅ OCI ✅
    - 0 failures, 0 incidents (all operational - correct behavior)
    - Database verification: 1,000 rows, 100% have `is_active` populated
    - 7 regions in `region_status_current` table
    - Functions working: `calculate_region_status()`, `update_region_status_summary()`
    - Real-time subscriptions configured and tested
    - Test script: `scripts/comprehensive-db-test.js`
    - Test results: 7 passed, 0 failed, 1 warning (index verification limitation)
